# LiDAR-Based SLAM 
## Overview

This repository contains the steps and methods utilized to accurately preform 
SLAM utilizing sensor data from encoders, LIDAR, IMUâ€™s, and a RGBD camera. To do 
this we will implement several methods for localization such as encoder/IMU estimation 
and ICP scan matching. We also create occupancy grids using both lidar and 
camera approximations. Finally, we optimize the path estimations using factor 
graph optimization. The methods discussed in this project can be widely applied to 
localization and mapping projects as they are built on basic principles and therefore 
easily generalized.

## Features

    Encoder and IMU odometry: Utilizes encoder and IMU data to estimate the robot's position and orientation.

    Scan Matching: Uses ICP to match LIDAR scans and estimate the robot's position and orientation.
    
    Occupancy Grid Mapping: Constructs occupancy grids using LIDAR and camera data.

    Texture mapping: Constructs and occupancy grid using camera data.

    Factor Graph Optimization: Optimizes the robot's path estimation using factor graph optimization.
